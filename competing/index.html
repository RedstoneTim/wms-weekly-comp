Welcome to the ZZ Method Solvers Discord Weekly Competition! This competition will run every week, with new scrambles being provided at 6pm Monday Sydney Time, sometimes earlier or later, depending on real life. Results will be revealed for the previous competition when the next scrambles are put up. A top 3 overall leaderboard across all weeks will also be tracked for each event. Finally, if anyone has any suggestions for how the comp should be run, or any questions, feel free to let me know!

How to participate:

Time your solutions for each scramble of each event you would like to participate in using a program such as CSTimer.
Take the average of five solves for each event. If not using an automatic calculator, this can be found by removing the slowest and fastest solves and taking the mean of the remaining three.
Enter all results (except FMC) in total seconds rather than minutes and seconds
For Fewest Moves Competition (FMC) use up to one hour to find an efficient solution. Make sure to copy your solution into alg.cubing.net so I can verify it is legitimate.
Follow the bit.ly links provided with the relevant week’s scrambles. Enter your results into the google form.

Rules:

Be honest with your times! There’s no prize, but it makes it more fun for everyone if you don’t cheat!
While solving, follow as many WCA regulations as you can. Spacebar timing is permitted, but other regulations such as inspection and penalties should be followed where possible.
For 3x3 events (3x3, OH, FMC) you must use ZZ or an EO first ZZ derivative, such as Portico. Methods such as LEOR and Roux are disallowed due to not being EO first methods. If you are unsure if your method is permitted, please ask!
FMC is supposed to be efficiency practice for speedsolving, so try to stick closely to techniques you would use under these conditions.
The move count metric used for FMC is STM. FMC solutions must be done similar to a speed solve, so techniques such as NISS, insertions etc are disallowed.
FMC solutions MUST be included when submitting results using an alg.cubing.net link.

Rules:
1. Do your best to comply with as many WCA regs as you can (inspection/penalties/etc.), but we don't mind if you solve using the keyboard.
2. Be honest with your times, we run on a trust basis, let's make this fun and fair for everyone.
3. The only methods allowed for 3x3, OH and FMC are Roux and its variants (ZBroux, Pinky Pie).
4. FMC is counted in STM, and is meant as efficiency practice. Techniques that can't be done linearly (like NISS and insertions) cannot be used in FMC.
5. Only Roux based methods are allowed on 4x4 (Rouxduction, Meyer, Stadler).
6. If you're not sure whether a method/technique is allowed or not, ask in the comments.
7. The comp runs until Sunday noon Eastern time (more or less). Enter your times using the forms links below.

Rules:
- Try to follow the WCA regulations as closely as possible. Timing your solves using a keyboard is permitted.
- Please be honest about your times to keep the competition fair and fun.
- All solves (including FMC) must be done with Waterman or one of its variants, where Roux is explicitly excluded.
- FMC is counted in STM and should reflect speedsolving. Therefore, non-linear techniques (such as NISS and insertions) are forbidden.
<b>- The results are submitted by direct messaging the bot in the format <pre>event: time1 time2 time3 time4 time5</pre> (e.g. <pre>3x3 One-Handed: 1:07.08 51.66 43.05 46.67 38.83</pre> or <pre>FMC: alg.cubing.net/cubedb.net-solution</pre> for FMC.</b>
- The competition ends at the time given in the last line of the bot's message.
- If any questions arise, do not refrain to ask them in the discord server.
