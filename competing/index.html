<h1>Rules:</h1>
Try to follow the WCA regulations as closely as possible. Timing your solves using a keyboard is permitted.
<ol><li>Please be honest about your times to keep the competition fair and fun.</li>
<li>All solves (including FMC) must be done with Waterman or one of its variants, where Roux is explicitly excluded.</li>
<li>FMC is counted in STM and should reflect speedsolving. Therefore, non-linear techniques (such as NISS and insertions) are forbidden.</li>
<b><li>The results are submitted by direct messaging the bot in the format <pre>event: time1 time2 time3 time4 time5</pre> (e.g. <pre>3x3 One-Handed: 1:07.08 51.66 43.05 46.67 38.83</pre> or <pre>FMC: alg.cubing.net/cubedb.net-solution</pre> for FMC.</b></li>
<li>The competition ends at the time given in the last line of the bot's message.</li>
<li>If any questions arise, do not refrain to ask them in the discord server.</li>
